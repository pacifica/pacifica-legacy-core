<p>A MyEMSL bundle is an uncompressed tar file with the data in the root of the tar, with one aditional file at the root, "metadata.txt".</p>

<p>Ths metadata.txt file is a json encoded file with the following format:</p>
<pre>
{
	"version":"1.0.0",
	"eusInfo":{
		"proposalID":"prop1",
		"groups":[
			{"name":"grpname", "type":"grptype"},
			{"name":"grpname2", "type":"grptype2"}
		]
	},
	"file":[
		{"sha1Hash":"26345e9061642efeb2b9d2da11baaa998b4b4fd9","fileName":"sample_ingest.xml","destinationDirectory":""}
		{"sha1Hash":"92996b1aeb2d4118fa386e0f733101fac78df48f","fileName":"Clean Phenakite_013.tif","destinationDirectory":"Clean"},
	]
}</pre>

<p>Version must be "1.0.0" currently.</p>

<p>"ProposalID" is optional, but should be set to the proposal id if you wish to link files to a proposal.</p>

<p>You must have at least one group specified. Groups are used to store metadata like instrument, or other things people will want to catagorize and filter on.</p>

<p>For each file in the bundle (except the metadata.txt file), there should be an entry in the "file" section. It must have a valid "sha1Hash" propertly. "fileName" and "destinationDirectory" also must match up with the filename in the bundle.</p>
