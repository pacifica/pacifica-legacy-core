The DMS Path service allows a user to find the most recent file items that they submitted by path. The results are by default returned in a json document.

The url should be the subdir path you are interested in listing.
for example:
532_Singer_Bacteria/IPV201206061338_Auto847894

The following HTTP GET option is supported:
 * auth - If specified, myemsl_auth tokens will be added to the result.
          All the tokens will be in an array under the key 'myemsl_auth'.
          Each file record will contain a 'token' property that is the offset
          of the token in the array to use for that file.
